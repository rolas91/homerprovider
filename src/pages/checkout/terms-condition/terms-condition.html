      <li><strong> COPYRIGHT DISPUTE POLICY </strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>HEXchange adopts the general policy toward copyright infringement in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) (<strong>http://www.lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/legislation/dmca.pdf</strong>). The address of HEXchange&rsquo;s Designated Agent to receive notification of claimed infringement ("Designated Agent") is provided at the bottom of this section.</p>
      <p><strong>HEXchange Policy. </strong></p>
      <p>Our policy is to (a) block access to or remove material that it believes in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members or other users; and (b) remove and discontinue Service to repeat offenders.</p>
      <p><strong>Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements.</strong></p>
      <p>If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through the site or the services infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below ("Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification"):</p>
      <p>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed;<br /> Identification of works or materials being infringed;<br /> Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that HEXchange is capable of finding and verifying its existence;</p>
      <p>Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number and, if available, email address;<br /> A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</p>
      <p>A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.</p>
      <p><strong>Upon Receipt of a Bona Fide Infringement Notification. </strong></p>
      <p>Once a Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is received by the Designated Agent, it is HEXchange&rsquo;s policy:</p>
      <p>to remove or disable access to the infringing material;<br /> to notify the content provider, member or user that it has removed or disabled access to the material; and<br /> for repeat offenders, to terminate such content to provider&rsquo;s, member's or user's access to the Service.</p>
      <p><strong>Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent. </strong></p>
      <p>If the content provider, member or user believes that the material that was removed or to which access was disabled is either not infringing, or the content provider, member or user believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, the content provider, member or user must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:</p>
      <p>A physical or electronic signature of the content provider, member or user;</p>
      <p>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;<br /> A statement that the content provider, member or user has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the material; and</p>
      <p>The content providers, members or user's name, address, telephone number, and, if available, email address and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content providers, members or user's address is located, or if the content providers, members or user's address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which HEXchange is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</p>
      <p><strong>Removal. </strong></p>
      <p>If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, HEXchange may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner les an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at HEXchange&rsquo;s discretion.</p>
      <p>Address for Designated Agent. Please contact HEXchange&rsquo;s Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement at the following address:</p>

<p><strong>Hexchange Privacy Authorization </strong></p>
<p>HEXchange offers services, such as helping you to understand and learn about nearby healthcare providers, booking appointments with the healthcare provider(s) of your choice (each, &ldquo;Your Healthcare Provider&rdquo;) and managing and forwarding your health history forms and other health-related information to share with Your Healthcare Providers (&ldquo;HEXchange Services&rdquo;). As part of providing the HEXchange Services, HEXchange may collect, use, share, and exchange your health history forms and other health-related information with Your Healthcare Providers. Under a federal law called the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (&ldquo;HIPAA&rdquo;), some of this health and health-related information may be considered &ldquo;protected health information&rdquo; or &ldquo;PHI&rdquo; if such information is received from or on behalf of Your Healthcare Providers.</p>
<p><strong>Safeguards for PHI </strong></p>
<p>HIPAA protects the privacy and security of your PHI by limiting the uses and disclosures of PHI by most healthcare providers and by health plans (called &ldquo;Covered Entities&rdquo;) as well as companies, like HEXchange, that provide certain types of assistance to Covered Entities (called &ldquo;Business Associates&rdquo;). Under certain circumstances described in HIPAA, an individual needs to sign an Authorization form before a Covered Entity, like Your Healthcare Provider(s), can disclose protected health information to a third party.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Protected Health Information </strong></p>
<p>As a condition of creating your HEXchange account, you are required to read and agree to HEXchange&rsquo;s <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>. HEXchange&rsquo;s Privacy Policy explains how HEXchange processes and shares information received from you that is not covered by HIPAA (&ldquo;Non-PHI&rdquo;).</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your PHI Authorization </strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this HEXchange Authorization (&ldquo;Authorization&rdquo;) is to request your written permission to allow HEXchange to use and disclose your PHI in the same way as we use and disclose your Non-PHI. If HEXchange is a Business Associate of Your Healthcare Providers, HEXchange needs your Authorization to be able to use and disclose your PHI in the same way it can currently use and disclose your Non-PHI when HEXchange is not working on behalf of Your Healthcare Providers, but is instead working on its own behalf. Therefore, when HEXchange relies on this Authorization, and uses and discloses PHI as described in this Authorization, it is not working as a Business Associate and the HIPAA requirements that apply to Business Associates will not apply to such uses and disclosures.</p>
<p>If you e-sign this Authorization, you give your permission to HEXchange to retain your PHI and to use and/or disclose your PHI in the same way that you have agreed that your Non-PHI can be used and disclosed.</p>
<p>Specifically, you agree that HEXchange can use your PHI to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable and customize your use of the HEXchange Services</li>
<li>Provide you alerts or other HEXchange Services regarding future appointments</li>
<li>Notify you regarding providers we think you may be interested in learning more about</li>
<li>Share information with you regarding services, products or resources about which we think you may be interested in learning more;<br /> provide you with updates and information about the HEXchange Services</li>
<li>Market to you about HEXchange and third-party products and services;</li>
<li>Conduct analysis for HEXchange&rsquo;s business purposes</li>
<li>Support development of the HEXchange Services and</li>
<li>Create de-identified information and then use and disclose this information in any way permitted by law, including to third parties in connection with their commercial and marketing eorts.</li>
</ul>
<p>You also agree that HEXchange can disclose your PHI to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Third parties assisting HEXchange with any of the uses described above</li>
<li>Your Healthcare Providers to enable them to refer you to, and make appointments with, other providers on your behalf, or to perform an analysis on potential health issues or treatments, provided that you choose to use the applicable HEXchange Service</li>
<li>A third party as part of a potential merger, sale or acquisition of HEXchange</li>
<li>Our business partners who assist us by performing core services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, or data storage and security) related to the operation or provision of our services, even when HEXchange is no longer working on behalf of Your Healthcare Providers</li>
<li>A provider of medical services, in the event of an emergency; and</li>
<li>Organizations that collect, aggregate and organize your information so they can make it more easily accessible to your providers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Redisclosure </strong></p>
<p>If HEXchange discloses your PHI, HEXchange will require that the person or entity receiving your PHI agrees to only use and disclose your PHI to carry out its specific business obligations to HEXchange or for the permitted purpose of the disclosure (as described above). HEXchange cannot, however, guarantee that any such person or entity to which HEXchange discloses your PHI or other information will not re-disclose it in ways that you or we did not intend or permit.</p>
<p><strong>Expiration and Revocation of Authorization </strong></p>
<p>Your Authorization remains in effect until you provide written notice of revocation to HEXchange.</p>
<p>YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR MIND AND REVOKE THIS AUTHORIZATION AT ANY TIME AND FOR ANY (OR NO) REASON.</p>
<p>If you wish to revoke this Authorization, you must notify HEXchange by submitting a revocation through your account settings page. Your decision not to execute this Authorization or to revoke it at any time will not affect your ability to use certain of the HEXchange Services. A Revocation of Authorization is effective after you submit it to HEXchange, but it does not have any effect on HEXchange&rsquo;s prior actions taken in reliance on the Authorization before revoked.</p>
<p>Once HEXchange receives your Revocation of Authorization, HEXchange can only use and disclose your PHI as permitted in HEXchange&rsquo;s agreements with Your Healthcare Provider(s). Your Revocation of Authorization does not affect HEXchange&rsquo;s use of your Non- PHI.</p>
<p>We will make available to Your Healthcare Provider(s), current and past, your agreement to or revocation of this Authorization.</p>
